# bookGoals
A minimalist application to help authors track their writing goals and meet their deadlines. This app allows a user to create their book listing (the book they're writing), add their "words to write" goals to complete their book, as well as update and delete the listings. 

* A project description
    * Who uses it? Authors/writers will use this application to add their current projects/books and word goals they'd like to hit as well as set their own deadline. Authors will benefit from this app by tracking their word goals, making sure they're on track and viewing their progress per project. 
    * What outputs do they need? A visual card which displays the name of their project/book, total amount of words the book should be, and their current words they've written. They should also have the option to add a deadline and have the "Days left" be displayed.
    * What inputs are needed to generate those outputs? The user needs to supply the title of their project, the numbered words they want to write, and their current words they've written as well as a deadline if they want. 
* A list of technologies that you plan to use - Node/Express for the backend, MongoDB, Ejs for engine templating, and bootstrap for the frontend. 
* An MVP with listed user stories
  * As a user I can add my book title into the app, total words I want to write for my book, and the current words I've written so far. 
  * As a user I want to be able to update my listing such as the title of my book or my word goals
  * As a user I want to be able to set a deadline and see how many days I have left. 
  * As a user I want to be able to delete my book listing after I'm finished writing my book
* A list of "Nice to have" features
  * As a user I want to be able to upload my album cover if I have one
  * As a user I want to be able to set a timer in the app to remind myself to take a break
